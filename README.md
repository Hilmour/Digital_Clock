# Digital Clock

## Installation of Digital clock:

- Click 'Start debugging'


## Technologies used:
- JavaScript
- CSS

### Notes/understanding of code:
- A simple but effective digital clock, practicing the use of conditional (ternary) operators.
- Call the 'showTime()' function to get the current Date and Time in hours (h), minutes (m) and seconds (s).
- 'if' statements used to differentiate between when 'AM' turns to 'PM and vice versa. 


### Last thoughts:
- My first small project to get the ball rolling. You can get in contact at socials linked in my profile. Enjoy!
