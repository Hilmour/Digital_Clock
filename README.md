# Digital_clock

Installation of Digital clock:
- Clone repository
- Open HTML file
- Click 'Run' in the top of the screen between 'Go' and 'Terminal'
- Click 'Start debugging' and us your local enviroment



Notes/understanding of code:
- A simple but effective digital clock, practicing the use of conditional (ternary) operators.
- Call the 'showTime()' function to get the current Date and Time in hours (h), minutes (m) and seconds (s).
- 'if' statements used to differentiate between when 'AM' turns to 'PM and vice versa. 


Conclusion:
- My first small project to get the ball rolling. Contact at socials linked in my profile. Enjoy!
